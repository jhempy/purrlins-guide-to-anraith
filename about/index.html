<p>
Not all who read this account of my life and work will actually know me; as remedy, I shall provide a brief biography.
</p>

<p>
    I am not Human, though for widest understanding I write in the common speech of that race. I am <em>Tabaxi</em> - a bold, inquisitive race of creatures with the sleek coat and agile grace of great felines. We walk upright and enjoy all the pleasures that come from intelligence and adroitness. Our culture is rich and vibrant, with a long history and a bright future. My name translates to "Bird On The Other Side Of The Window", but my humanoid companions complain that is too lengthy and instead call me "Purrlin"<label for="sn-nickname" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-nickname" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I understand this to be an homage to a great wizard, so I permit it.</span>.

    As a daughter in a prominent family, my childhood was spent honing skills
    both physical and mental. I had some aptitude for scholarship, and when
    adulthood approached, my parents arranged - as was my dream! - that I might
    continue my studies at Heliomaine's Academy. The <span class="tower">Tower</span>,
    as it is known to its students and professors, is an institute of such 
    reputation as to have no peers. 
</p>

<p>
    My early years as a scholar were a delight. I attended lectures given by the greatest minds of our time. I engaged in lively discussion with my fellow students. I counted all I knew as my friends<label for="sn-rival" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-rival" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Save for a certain rival who, jealous of my natural talents and easy mastery of all subjects I set my mind to, cast aspersions upon my character and sought to discredit me. He was quickly brought 'round by my many supporters and as a result, discredited himself. He remains at the Academy, though in a diminished role, and I give him no further thought.</span> - I had found a home at the <span class="tower">Tower</span>, and I flourished. That is, until the course of my study progressed to topics reserved for only the most diligent and advanced students.

    Serious researchers complete their lives' work in the <span class="tower">Tower's</span> Great Library. Individual laboratories and workrooms fill the Great Library's lower levels, and I count it among my happiest days when I was assigned my own small space in those hallowed halls. Joyfully I made myself comfortable in that tiny room! And with reverence and deepest respect, I prepared to introduce myself to my neighbors.
</p>

<p>
    That is when I noticed <em>I had none</em>. The rooms adjacent to mine were unoccupied, as were the rooms in the nearest hallways. Indeed, I had to walk a good 5 minutes to find anyone at all in the research rooms below the Great Library!

<p>
    It was this revelation, combined with suggestions from my research into the nature of spell creation, that lead me to understand how, in our modern age, the art and science of arcane magic has stagnated. Whether from natural atrophy or diabolical plot, I knew not. However, a few weeks of careful reading revealed that no new spells had been recorded in the Great Library's vast catalog since long before I was born.

<p>
    This unexpected discovery became the focus of my attention. Ever since, I have devoted my time to discovering the methods by which magical formulae are derived and spells created.<label for="sn-cv" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-cv" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">My curriculum vitae can be viewed <a href="/about/curriculum-vitae.html">here</a>.</span> It has become my passion, my muse, my fire, and my purpose. Now, gentle reader, may you better understand that which drove me to the adventures you now read!
