<h2>Positions Held</h2>

<ul>
    <li><em>Research Fellow, 1572 - present.</em> In addition to modest teaching responsibilities, I was given leave to pursue topics of special interest. I am currently following confidential leads toward undocumented knowledge, to be preserved for the benefit of all.</li>

    <li><em>Instructional Assistant, 1571 - 1572.</em> As a brilliant, diligent, and trusted pupil, I was entrusted with instructional duties far beyond the usual for one as young as myself. All but final grades were my purview, and even those were reviewed with the most casual eye.</li>

    <li><em>Editor, Tower Gazette, 1570 - 1572.</em> Duties included planning upcoming issues, soliciting authors, collection and editing of essays and articles, and contributing an Editor's Note which was featured prominently in each issue. As a young researcher ever keen to be "in the know," it was a delightful way to stay current with my fellow students' work. I continue to subscribe even though my editorship concluded upon graduation and my research is now published in more select compendiums.</li>
