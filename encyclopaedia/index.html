<p>
    It appears that I shall be some time wandering Anraith<label for="sn-party" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-party" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I blame my companions, fully and completely.</span> before returning to my treasured <span class="tower">Tower</span>. In the despair induced by this anticipated long absence, I see a spark of hope: nowhere in the Great Library's vast collection is a treatise that summarizes all the known world in a single voice during a single era. Could this be my contribution to that venerable institution? As circumstance propels me to the edges of the world, I shall collect my thoughts and observations even as I labor toward my ultimate goal: the methods of magical creation. Thus my quill shall remain inked, my eye clear, and my wits sharp!
