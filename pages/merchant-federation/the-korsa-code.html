The "code zi Korsa" that governs the isle of Korsagrad is fairly straight forward and simple:
 
killing (weather intentional or not) is punished by death Thieving (weather by slight of hand, or trickery) is punished by time in the stocks any captain shall be held accountable along with any crew that commits crimes under their manifest. Should the captain themselves be the offender, their entire crew is subject to the sentence.
 
For example if crew member A gets into a bar fight and kills a man, both the crew man and the captain are hung.
 
If a captain is found cheating at cards, his entire crew is rounded up and placed in the stocks.
 
Every stock has a key right next to it. the allegation laid against the accused is written above them, and when they were placed in the stocks. This allows the public consensus to determine how long the time in stocks should be.
 
As for the adjudication of killing. There is literal tolerance for bloodshed of any sort. Trails are quick and enforcement is public. swift justice is prioritized over certainty, if more than one party could be considered at fault? they both hang. A city full of pirates is not a place where any violence can be reasonably tolerated.
