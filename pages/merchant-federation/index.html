The Ostrovyet Islands are uniquely situated directly in the tradewinds that lead to the dark shores. As a result they are the global epicenter of trade and shipping. While every one of the other world powers may claim authority to outposts and land in the islands, the de facto government is the merchant federation. A loose and informal group of wealthy cartels and individuals that control their sectors of the various islands as they see fit. While the power of the Federation members is unquestioned, enforcement of any "laws'' is difficult on the high seas between the isles.
