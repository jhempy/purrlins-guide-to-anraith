The Island of Nisos currently disputes weather or not it is a part of the kingdom. A third of the population considers themselves members of the kingdom but has rejected the church of Deus. Another third the other way around, and the rest of the population falls somewhere in between. In addition to being a relatively defensible island, the shipwrights of Nisos are universally accepted as the best Galenian Naval technology has to offer. So, while the crown and the scepter both still claim the land officially, the city is largely able to defend itself from those claims being enforced for now.
