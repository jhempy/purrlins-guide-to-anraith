title: The Role of Primus

<p>
    The highest authority in a Sabvian city-state is the <em>Primus</em>. Each city-state has different rules for the selection, term of office, and replacement of their Primus. Efforts to standardize have met with resistance, as the city-states are historically unique and independent.

<p>
    The Primus' main responsibility is the governance of their city-state, but in addition, the Primus is also responsible for appointing representatives to the Council of Envoys - the senate that handles concerns which affect all city-states, such as diplomatic relations with other countries.
