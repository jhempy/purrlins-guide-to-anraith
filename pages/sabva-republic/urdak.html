<p>
    The largest city in the Sabva Republic is Urdak. Located at the southeastern corner of the continent, on an inlet with many small islands, Urdak boasts an impressive number of ports that cater to an equally impressive number of ships. The city is divided into six boroughs, two of which are coastal.

    Urdak's prominent role as a port city guarantees vast numbers of visitors and thus, unfortunately, a high rate of crime. The citizens of Urdak are unwilling to be victims, and within each borough a family assumed control, regulating the local gangs as well as transient wrongdoers. Though their rule is technically outside the law, the City Watch maintains a tense standoff with these families, acknowledging the effectiveness of their brutal ways and turning a blind eye to the liberties and transgressions.
