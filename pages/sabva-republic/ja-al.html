The republic of Sabva breeds artisans and poets of all stripes, but you will not find them here in Ja-a'l. If you need a beautiful ceremonial hammer that will inspire awe in your guests when you put it on display, go to Fannhia. Here in Ja-a'l you would get a hammer that you can use long enough that it will outlive your great grandchildren and even in a generation still crack any anvil not made by the same master forgers of the Iron city of efficiency that is Ja-a'l.
