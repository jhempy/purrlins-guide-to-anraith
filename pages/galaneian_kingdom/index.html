An agrarian and feudal society, the kingdom of Galanei spreads across huge swaths of fertile farmland. Dukes pay tribute to the crown and the crown provides an army to protect against the hordes of the rift lands to the east. The crown also rules by divine birthright, the royal bloodline being given the mandate of Deus. The two power structures between the Monarchy and the church are largely cooperative, however occasional rifts between the king and pontiff do happen. The Nobility and Priesthood have roughly equal support and loyalty of the populous. Although with the introduction of the mass assembly scroll scriber and spreading literacy throughout the kingdom... the word of Deus and the divine right of the crown are being questioned by some radicals.
