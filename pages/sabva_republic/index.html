The city states of the Sabva republic span the rocky archipelago of their north eastern shores. Small pockets of farmable land separated by Fjords and mountains lead to each city being mostly autonomous, with the republic a very slim central authority. The people are industrious and known for their mining and metal work, each city has its own patron deity and rivalries between city states are not uncommon. The people there have a history of migration and cultural pride in hospitality to strangers, making them very open to beings of different races.
