The caliphate has ruled the entire length (if not the width) of the western continent for nearly 1200 years now. The central authority of the eastern coast lays claim to the deserts west of the mountain, but considering the dearth of commerce / agricultural / anything of use in that region the desert nomads of the scorched wastes are functionally autonomous. The mountains that rise past the coast form the backbone of this theocratic empire, with the most advanced system of roads in the world, communication between the various latitudes is robust and allows for the strong central authority of the Caliph. Due the nature of the Religion, the region is paradoxically both extremely accepting of non-heteronormative peoples and highly prejudiced against the "non-common" races (elfs , humans, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes are considered standard)
