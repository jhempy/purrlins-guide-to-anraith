title: On Mana Crystals
---

<p>
    Perhaps the most important exports of the Dark Continent are <em>mana crystals</em>, gems that store magical potential. The formation of mana crystals is unknown, but their applications are many. Mana crystals fuel lights, provide heat, power transportation, and sustain magical barriers and protections. In the past 300 years, their usefulness has reached every industry. Mana crystals are present in whimsical toys for lucky children, household appliances, machinery and automata, and weaponry.

    The potency of a mana crystal depends its size. For example, a crystal the size of a pebble can fuel a magical light indefinitely, while a one-pound crystal (about the size of an apple) can release enough energy to power a first-level spell. While this may at first seem similar to a general spell scroll, that is a shallow comparison. A spell scroll binds magic for a single use of a single spell in a form that can be activated later. A one-pound mana crystal can release energy to power <em>any</em> first-level spell, and it can release that energy repeatedly. For that reason, mana crystals are in great demand and their values increase exponentially with their size.

    Two notable, common uses of mana crystals are <em>sailors' rations</em> and <em>mana-grog grana</em>, both of which provide nourishment during long sea voyages.

    Made by mixing mana crystal powder<label for="sn-powder" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-powder" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A byproduct of the the mining and refinement of mana crystals.</span> with flour and water, then forming bars from the dough and allowing it to dry, sailors' rations are both an improvement to and step back from hardtack and other long-lasting biscuits. Sailors' rations are ideally nutritive; a small bar can nourish an adult humanoid for an entire day. They stay fresh indefinitely and do not attract insects or rodents. However, additional ingredients (such as nuts, berries, sweeteners, salt, herbs, spices, or other flavor enhancers) are oddly neutralized by the presence of mana powder. They affect the texture of the ration only; no difference is detected in taste, which is a considerable drawback as sailor's rations have a bland, unappealing taste.

    Mana-grog grana is made in a similar way. Rum and fresh water are mixed with mana powder to form a concentrate. A small amount of concentrate is then added to seawater to form a hydrating beverage. As with sailors' rations, the taste is bland and unappealing and flavorants are neutralized immediately. However, the concentrate lasts indefinitely.

    <em>Note:</em> Long-term consumption of sailor's rations and mana-grog grana is associated with mental symptoms similar to those of severe deprivation.
