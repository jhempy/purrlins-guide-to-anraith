Referred to by the locals as "the inkwell" the island of the coast of the dark shore is plunged into perpetual night. The phases of the moon come and go but the sun never penetrates this land. no one knows why but almost certainly has to do with the rich vein of mana crystals that lie beneath the constant torchlight of Arcums wharf.
