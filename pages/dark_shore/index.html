The continent where mana crystals are mined. Home to creatures of power and indigouness groups of "non-standard" races. Colonies have been established along the northern coast of the continent whose name comes from the black sand of its beaches, but no permanent settlement has been successful in the wilds of the jungle beyond. Every attempt has been met with a different disaster (monsters, volcanic eruption, disease, madness, and in one case sudden disappearance of the entire settlement) Many people believe the entire continent to be cursed. tropical at the northern shore but stretching all the way to the arctic region. There is no complete map as of yet for this mystical and dangerous land.
