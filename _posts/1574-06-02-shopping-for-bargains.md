<p>
    There's nothing quite like a little shopping to brighten one's outlook after a close call with organized crime!
</p>

<p>
    The day began inauspiciously. Like most patrons of <em>Sari's Stow-Away Saaray</em>, we breakfasted downstairs in the common room. Sari approached us and apologetically let us know that our grace period had ended, and hereafter she expected a gold each per day for continued residence. Sari is a middle-aged, matronly human woman with a penchant for accumulating strays; when we found her establishment, we were bedraggled and penniless and in desperate need<label for="sn-strays" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-strays" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">That is to say, exactly her type of guest.</span>. Her generosity was a godsend and none of us begrudged the coins we handed to her. That price was perhaps a bit steep for shelter of this quality, but as we partook of her charity, so will others and someone needs to fund her enterprise. At least the lamps are always lit and the vituals are plentiful and filling, if not varied, interesting, or tasty.
</p>

<p>
    The <em>Stow-Away</em> has 30-some-odd rooms. Some of them are occupied long-term and others for just a night or two, ensuring both familiar faces and new ones every day at mealtime. This morning, we were joined by a stony warforged named Hudson. As he was also looking for items of particular interest to add to his kit, he accompanied us to the merchant district and then to the broad avenue where Urdak's magic shoppes are to be found. Hudson listened politely as we schemed about taking revenge upon the Nebet family, but he did not contribute. He appears to have not (yet?) run afoul of the Nebets, but did not seem to pass judgement upon our need for petty revenge.
</p>

<p>
    The first thing one notices upon arrival in the magic district is the poshness. Of all the placed we've roamed in the city, this was the cleanest, most orderly, most elegant, most refined and elegant. Everything spoke of quality, from the paving in the street to the wood in the doors to the glass in the windows to the paint on the signs. And the air practically crackled with magical potential. I breathed deeply, feeling at home for the first time since leaving my beloved <span class="tower">Tower</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Each of us wished to obtain a particular item. Beat wanted an enchanted drum to replace the one the Nebets had slashed, one that would enhance his playing and resist future vandalism. Our first stop was a purveyor of bardic instruments. Like all shoppes in this district<label for="sn-remis" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-remis" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Save one, which I shall get to presently.</span>, the great wooden door was dominated by a seal proclaiming this establishment as guild-sanctioned. Interesting. I filed that away for later reference.
</p>

<p>
    Despite our lack of appropriate attire<label for="sn-manners" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-manners" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">And, in the case of my companions, appropriate manners.</span>, we were treated with courtesy. They did not have a drum such as Beat wanted, but they did have a viola of delicate craftsmanship and excellent enchantment. Beat was most enamored of it, even though it was not his preferred instrument. The price was quite high, though - 850 gold. In a gesture of surprising compassion, Grom placed a 400 gold deposit on the item and we moved onward, eager to see what other marvels we might find.
</p>

<p>
    Our next stop was an amuletery. Aldritch hoped to find a talisman that would amplify and focus his connection with his god. The proprietor found one such device, and though it was dedicated to a different god than Aldritch worships, we were assured it would function properly for any diety of similar inclination. At 900 gold, however, it was beyond our means. The proprietor was kindly, and suggested<label for="sn-suggestion" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-suggestion" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">With great reservation, it must be noted.</span> that should our budget preclude patronage of sanctioned magic shoppes, we might try <em>Remi's Secondhand and Discount Magic Item Emporium</em>, the only non-sanctioned magic shoppe permitted in Urdak, which we could not fail to notice if we simply continued down the boulevard. We thanked him for his suggestion and moved along.
</p>

<p>
    Remi's <em>Emporium</em> was indeed easy to find. In fact, one could barely avoid it. The signage was exceedingly vulgar; there were enchantments upon it to make the caricature of Remi appear to move. And such signs were posted with increasing regularity as we grew closer. The front of the establishment was decorated with tall, thin, dancing canvas effigies of beasts and monstrosities, powered it seemed by air elementals. What a brazen display of poor taste!
</p>

<p>
    The word "emporium" conjures to mind images of dusty curio shoppes and crowded booksellers, with items piled high at the ends of rows of overstuffed shelves, where one might spend the whole of an afternoon investigating treasures of all sorts and explore but a small portion of the trove. This was technically correct for Remi's place of business, but rather than a cozy shoppe with a quirky, ancient owner, we found a sprawling complex of drafty warehouses full of the most random items one could possibly imagine. Row after row, rack after rack, bin after bin of expended, decaying, misenchanted, and plain broken items spilled across the aisles in a veritable junkyard of...alas, junk.
</p>

<p>
    Remi himself was quite the character. Just as brash and uncooth as his advertisements, he is a short human male with a bad haircut who affects an eyepatch. His speech is both overly-familiar and direct, and one cannot trust a word of it. He approached us soon after our arrival and presented several items for our consideration: a set of cursed plate armor that burned everything within reach<label for="sn-burn" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-burn" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Including the wearer!</span>, magicked bracers that attracted metal quite strongly, a religious amulet and a drum, both enchanted to enhance the bearer's metaphysical endeavors but with a weak recharge rate. My companions rejected all but the amulet and drum.
</p>

<p>
    Three things of note occurred during our conversation with Remi. First, Remi offered to sell us a tamed mimic. The mimic, however, was not in its cage. Remi used a special whistle to call his assistants<label for="sn-kobolds" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-kobolds" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">A never-ending supply of kobolds answered his summons.</span> and thereafter ensued a doomed attempt to capture said creature.
</p>

<p>
    Second, an attempted theft occurred. Six youths, hoods drawn, tried to "make off with the goods," as they say. Remi's guard, a warforged of no small stature, engaged several of the perpetrators while we pitched in to accost the rest. The scene must have touched a deep and hidden hurt somewhere inside Grom for he fell upon the scoundrels with a fury I have never seen before, not even in Drake's professional fights. We urged temperence but in the end, only one of the would-be thieves survived, and only because I imposed myself between Grom and the boy. We questioned him thoroughly<label for="sn-bummer" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-bummer" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I was hoping to uncover a deep conspiracy or new connection to the dastardly Nebets.</span>, but it just a childish prank gone quite wrong. Remi assured us that none of his inventory could pass a protective bubble around the <em>Emporium</em> unless paid for, and I don't doubt a businessman of his bent would have need of such protection. In acknowledgement of our service, Remi reluctantly offered Grom an enchanted greatsword with no defects for a good price.
</p>

<p>
    Finally - and most interestingly - Remi received a very important visitor, the Primus himself, Imhotep Nasir. As we learned in our brief conversation with the Primus, Nasir is a man of similar mind to Remi, and no great friend of the crime families that run his city. The Primus seemed quite glad to see us<label for="sn-justdrake" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-justdrake" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Actually, he was quite glad to see Drake, perplexed about Hudson, and unconcerned about the rest of us.</span> and immediately made an interesting request: deliver an item to the Nebet family at the upcoming meeting of crime families, two weeks hence.
</p>

<p>
    Further questioning revealed additional details about the situation: The Nebets were going to oppose Imhotep at the next election. Imhotep had asked Remi to obtain a gift for the Nebets that could be presented as a peace offering. Remi aquired a single crossbow bolt, which was housed in rune-covered box. The bolt was of exquisite manufacture, covered in gems and inscriptions of power. The upcoming meeting of criminal families would begin with promises of action for the next year, then each family would accept tribute from petitioners. We were to publicly present the bolt in its case to the Nebets during the tribute phase, and say,
</p>

<blockquote>
    <em>
        On behalf of the Primus of this great city, Imhotep Nasir,<br />
        we give you this offering of peace.<br />
        May it find the heart of your enemies.
    </em>
</blockquote>

<p>
    For this service, our transgressions with the Nebets would be forgiven and the Primus would pay 1,000 gold.
</p>

<p>
    At this point, our group<label for="sn-newguy" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-newguy" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Which now included Hudson as a member.</span> took momentary leave of the Primus to discuss our options. There was little debate, for we needed the money, but we tossed about the idea of perhaps earning a little more of the Nebets' ire before our slate was wiped clean.
</p>

<p>
    We accepted the job, leaving the bolt in Remi's care until closer to the time of the criminal convention. We departed for the <em>Stow-Away</em>, resolved to rest and recuperate until Drake's next fight, which was in about a week. Knowing how the Nebets feel about Drake, we considered the chances quite high that they'd try sometime to sabotage the match. Before we left Remi, however, I purchased both a length-changing staff and talkative shield named Victrum. The shield claimed that we would never be surprised in his company, which we confirmed by checking out its story with <em>identify</em>. The incessant chatter will certainly try our patience, but I have a feeling that Vikrum has a part to play in our little drama. Time will tell!
</p>

<p>
    Grom retrieved his down payment on the way home in classic Grom style<label for="sn-door" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-door" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">That is, with shouting and violence.</span>.
</p>
