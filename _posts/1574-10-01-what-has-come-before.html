title: What Has Come Before
---

<p>
    I find myself in the continuing company of some...<em>individuals</em>...and should - for the sake of completeness only, not fondness! - explain the circumstances that brought us together.
</p>

<p>
    Upon leaving the <span class="tower">Tower</span>, I proceeded seaward. My reasons for doing so still prick a tender heart, so I will leave that story for another time. Suffice it to say that the water called me, and the vastness of the sea between the continents inspired dreams of epic voyages, romantic and sweeping in scope.
</p>

<p>
    The backdrop of a clear, endless sky and rolling waves may make for a pretty painting, but in reality it is quite horrible. The air is heavy with salty spray that wrecks havoc upon one's fur. The sun is blinding, the wind is harsh, nothing stays where you put it due to the endless rocking of the ship, and everything reeks of rotting fish.<label for="sn-fish" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-fish" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Mind you, a fresh catch is quite delightful but it must be eaten and disposed of promptly!</span>
I found little, if anything, to recommend it.
</p>

<p>
    But fresh from the <span class="tower">Tower</span>, I had not yet learned what manner of hell the open sea could be, and in my ignorance, took employment upon a vessel named <em>Lady Fortune</em> as a cartographer and navigator's assistant. My knowledge of those subjects was, at the time, purely academic and I was thrilled for a chance to benefit from personal experience and thus extend my understanding.
</p>

<p>
    I adapted quickly to the roughness of my new situation. My claws gave me excellent footing upon the rolling deck, and I found it quite enjoyable to climb among the rigging, sails, and masts. The intricacies of navigation at sea kept my mind engaged, and I became a dab paw at tying knots. I also became acquainted with other hands upon the ship who would, as fate had it, become my future companions.
</p>

<p>
    Due to circumstances I never learned, <em>Lady Fortune</em> was crewed by less than was considered standard - or safe - for a vessel her size. This proved tragic, for mere weeks into our journey, a great storm blew across the sea and we were unable to save the ship. It cracked under the force of the waves that broke across her bow, and all hands save seven of us were lost.
</p>

<p>
    The morning after the terrible storm, we woke on the shore of an island<label for="sn-island" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-island" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">We later came to understand that this island was known, but not important enough to name.</span>. By grace of the many-tailed Hunter In The Sky, a strongbox full of my cartographic supplies was found among the wreckage strewn along the shore. My fellow survivors were:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Aldritch Anvilsong</em>, known to us as "Doc", a sturdy Dwarf of strong character and conviction,</li>
    <li><em>Beat</em>, a gentle but imposing Warforged with previous sailing experience,</li>
    <li><em>Draconus Wolfran</em>, a serious, taciturn Dragonborn with exceptional skills in martial arts,</li>
    <li><em>Grom "Da Bigges' Boi"</em>, a boisterous orc strongly motivated by coin, and</li>
    <li><em>Hudson</em>, a stern, forthright Warforged who followed - and enforced - the rules.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We each play to our strengths, and as my companions worked to build a raft, upon which we might sail back to civilized land, I investigated our temporary home. I mapped the coastline and as far back into the dense jungle as I could reasonably go. I catalogued the flora and fauna<label for="sn-seals" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-seals" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">We had the great misfortune to wash ashore at an elephant seal mating ground. It was being used for that purpose during our stay, and I still have nightmares about the savage courting practices of those giant beasts.</span>, identifying those which were safe to consume and warning the others of those that were not, and generally strove to learn as much as I could about the island. There were grumblings about my self-appointed tasks, but they didn't turn down the fresh water, fruits, or game I brought back to our meager camp!
</p>

<p>
    In time the raft, dubbed <em>Baby Fortune</em>, was completed. We packed what food and water we could upon it and pushed back out into the water that had so recently taken the lives of our shipmates.
</p>

<p>
    Our time aboard the raft was not easy, but in six days time we drifted into the shipping lanes near Urdak and were towed to dock. The sketches and notes I'd made on the island were of some small value and earned me enough coin to...blast them, I couldn't just abandon my companions now...provide meager lodgings and basic necessities for the six of us.
</p>

<p>
    Over the next few weeks, we industriously strove to restore our fortunes. And that, my friends, is worthy of its own entry in my journal!
