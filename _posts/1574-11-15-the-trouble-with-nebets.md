title: The Trouble With Nebets...
---

<p>
    Is that they are a <em>crime family</em>. The trouble with recent arrivals in Urdak is that they don't know the extent of the Nebets' control, and thus inadvertently make enemies of those they should steer well clear of.

    The few gold coins earned from the sale of my castaway notes did not last long. Once lodgings were secured and a few meals eaten, we were penniless again. With weariness born from weeks of deprivation and the burden of our losses, we feel back upon the skills that sustained us before we met upon the decks of <em>Lady Fortune</em>.

    Grom took odd jobs of the "smash and bash" sort. Aldrich formed a strange partnership with him: Grom brought back armor and weapons salvaged from his mercenary pursuits, and Aldrich refurbished them to resell at a higher price.

<p>
    Draconus entered the arena as a gladiator. We were not surprised to see how quickly his reputation built, as we'd seen him practicing his forms for months by now.

    Beat played his drum in the taverns of Urdak. His music tended to be a little repetitive - a habit formed from his many months calling out the rowing rhythm on his ship, I suppose - but he was nonetheless earning enough to help feed the poor as well as setting aside money to feed the rest of us.<label for="sn-beat" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-beat" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I think he was fascinated by the idea of eating, and naively blamed all the sorrows and misfortunes of a living creature on lack of food.</span>

    Mathematics and calculations had always come easily to me, so when I happened upon the traders' quarter and learned how voyages were financed, I realized an opportunity to put my analytical mind to work. In the morning, I would buy "shares" of cargo due to arrive  from their original investors, and throughout the day I would resell these "shares" to new investors hoping for their ship to come in - literally. I made a point of never carrying shares over from one day to the next - this ridiculous practice was simply too foolish to be believed! - any never took advantage of a poor soul's ignorance or bad luck. I paid fairly and made a modest margin for my efforts. And in this way I, too, accumulated a small sum and prepared for a time when my companions and I would no longer need to pool resources.

    Suddenly and without warning, each of us experienced a brush with the Nebet family, a criminal network that operates everywhere throughout our burrough in Urdak.
</p>

<p>
    Grom was informed that he had killed the wrong man during one of his hits, and the Nebets needed to enact retribution in order to preserve their standing in town. But as it was an honest mistake, and the man he killed was not particularly important, so the Nebets were content to simply "rough up" Grom "a bit." This statement was delivered within earshot of Aldrich, unfortunately. To his credit, he's a loyal friend. Aldrich stood with Grom against the Nebet enforcers. The fight was dirty and brutal. Grom received the beating he was due, and Aldrich received one he probably wasn't due, but the pair committed a new offense by fighting back, and the Nebets are none too pleased.
</p>

<p>
    Draconus was instructed to deliberately lose one of his fights so that the Nebets could make a profit by betting against him. He did not comply, and when the Nebets sent enforcers to express their displeasure, he soundly rebuffed them. The Nebets are deeply unhappy with Draconus and we are certain that they will respond promptly and with determination.
</p>

<p>
    Poor Beat! When told by one of the Nebets that he was not needed to perform that night, he good-naturedly joined the band anyway. He has no experience with jazz music and it showed, loudly and off-tempo. The band was humiliated, and they took their revenge upon him. Aldrich was able to repair Beat's drum but the wound to his self-esteem can't be so easily healed.

    Who knew that citrus and pineapple were so tightly controlled?<label for="sn-fruit" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-fruit" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Well, actually, I did. Fruit markets are notoriously corrupt.</span>I tried to explain that I acted in ignorance, and that my methods could easily be applied to other produce should they wish to offer suggestions. I escaped my encounter with the Nebets with a fine meal, and excellent cigar, and a business card for one "Larry the Ledger" - but under no circumstances am I to trade shares in Urdak again. They are, as they say, watching me.
</p>

<p>
    We compared experiences later that night, and I can say this for my companions: they may not be bright, and they may not understand how close they came to taking a permanent swim in the river, but they do look out for one another and they don't like to see each other pushed around. They agree that we need to get away from the Nebets for our own prosperity and longevity, but they want to go out with something of a bang. I can hear them scheming in the next room; their ideas are at best ill-advised, at worst merely deadly, and universally exceptionally terrible. I must put my pen down now, as it is clear that my talents are once again required.
