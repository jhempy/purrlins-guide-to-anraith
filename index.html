    Having left The Tower for an indeterminate amount of time, I deemed it
    worthwhile to keep a record of the places I have been, the creatures I have
    met, and the events I have witnessed unfold.

<p>
    Do forgive the sometimes banal surroundings and situations I describe. Not
    all the world is as orderly, serene, and conducive to careful thought as 
    my beloved Tower.
