<p>
    Having left the <span class="tower">Tower</span> for an indeterminate amount 
    of time, I deemed it worthwhile to keep a record of the places I have been, 
    the creatures I have met, and the events I have witnessed unfold. This is 
    all in addition to my normal meticulous research and documentation, of course.

<p>
    Do forgive the sometimes banal surroundings and situations I describe. Not
    all the world is as orderly, serene, and conducive to careful thought as 
    my beloved <span class="tower">Tower</span>.
